	<h3>Q3. [5] Explain the concept of a scenegraph and why it is useful.</h3>

	<p>
		A scenegraph is a strategic way of composing and visualizing complex graphics. An object that is wished to be drawned can be viewed as a tree like structure composed of other objects. much like binary trees in data structures, scenegraphs have a root node, pointing to its children (where each child can also point to other objects, and so on). The concept of a scenegraph is useful because we can draw a component of a large object and the transformations of its children are applied relative to its parent graphic. This means that we can go back to the previous transformation settings once we have finished rendering the graphics that compose a main component.
